## üßë‚Äçüç≥ Chef's Pro Tips

### üîç Before You Clean Your Kitchen:
1. **Taste before you toss** - Verify resources are truly unused
2. **Check the recipe book** - Some ingredients might be planned for future dishes
3. **Look for dependencies** - Some resources might be connected in ways not obvious

### ü§ñ Kitchen Automation:
```powershell
# Set up automated monthly kitchen cleaning reminders
# Create Azure Policy to prevent orphaned resources
# Implement resource tagging for better tracking
```

### üìÖ Regular Maintenance:
- Run this bisque recipe monthly for freshest results
- Set up alerts for resources unused > 30 days
- Implement consistent tagging strategies

---

## üç≥ Cooking Variations (Customization)

### Modify Ingredient Costs:
```powershell
# Update the cost variables in the script
$nicMonthlyCost = 1.50      # Adjust based on your region
$publicIpMonthlyCost = 3.65 # Update for current pricing
```

### Custom KQL Recipes:
The script uses two main "secret recipes" (KQL queries). You can customize these for different ingredients:

- **Lonely NIC Lettuce Detection**: Finds unattached Network Interface Cards
- **Crying Onion Public IP Discovery**: Locates unused Public IP addresses

---

## üÜò Kitchen Accidents (Troubleshooting)

### Common Cooking Mishaps:

**üö® "Required Azure PowerShell modules not found"**
```powershell
# Solution: Install the missing ingredients
Install-Module Az -Force -AllowClobber
```

**üö® "Access Denied" or "Insufficient Permissions"**
- Ensure you have `Reader` role on target subscriptions
- Verify `Resource Graph Reader` permissions
- Check with your Azure administrator for proper access

**üö® "No subscriptions found"**
```powershell
# Make sure you're connected to the right Azure tenant
Get-AzContext
Connect-AzAccount -TenantId "your-tenant-id"
```

**üö® "KQL Query Failed"**
- This usually indicates permission issues with Resource Graph
- Contact your Azure admin to grant Resource Graph access
